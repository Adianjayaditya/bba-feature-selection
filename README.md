# Parkinson's Disease Classification using SVM

This project aims to classify individuals with Parkinson's disease using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. The classification is based on biomedical voice measurements, helping in early diagnosis and analysis of the disease. The features used in this dataset are various speech signal processing algorithms including Time Frequency Features, Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), Wavelet Transform based Features, Vocal Fold Features and TWQT features of parkinson's disease patients.

## Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dipayanbiswas/parkinsons-disease-speech-signal-features)
- **Target Variable**: `status`  
  - `1` = Parkinsonâ€™s  
  - `0` = Healthy

## Technologies Used
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## Methods Used

- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Feature scaling (MinMaxScaler)
- Feature selection using Binary Bat Algorithm
- Model Evaluation using accuracy

## Results

- **Best Accuracy**: 92.5%  
- **Model**: SVM with Linear kernel
